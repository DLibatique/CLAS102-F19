title: Final Paper
---


This assignment asks you to write an argumentative essay in response to the question posed by a prompt. Your argument should be an answer to the question posed, and you will need to provide textual evidence through citations to support your answer and explain your reasoning.

## Due Date and Time
The end time on the date of the final exam, to be determined by the registrar.

## Length
5-6 pages, double-spaced.

## Grading criteria
When grading this assignment, I will be looking for:
- a clear and specific **argument**, supported by **textual evidence** drawn from our readings;
- a logical and coherent **structure** to your paper;
- accurate **citations of primary texts** in the proper format;
- careful writing, within the required length, in grammatically correct English, with very few or no spelling errors; and,
- for a higher grade, evidence of individual thought, and creative or sensitive insights into your chosen topic.

## Resources
You are free to come to my office hours or set up an appointment to discuss your chosen prompt or how to structure your paper. I am willing to read and offer suggestions on paper drafts, but you are not required to run a draft by me before the paper’s due date. I will not accept any drafts after **5pm on Sunday, 12/15,** to ensure that I can give you back my comments in a timely fashion before the paper's due date.

You can also make an appointment with the [Writer’s Workshop](https://www.holycross.edu/academics/support-and-resources/center-for-writing/writers-workshop); there, they can help you with organizing your thoughts and structuring your argument.

## Citations
Citations of primary source material (meaning the actual text of the author, and not introductions by an editor, footnotes, etc.) are necessary to support the claim that you are making in your argument. You should not cite material that is self-evident or that doesn’t bear on your argument.

You are required to cite primary source material **at least three (3) times** in your paper for prompts 1-4 and 6-8. For prompt 5, you are required to cite **at least five (5) inscriptions or graffiti**. This may involve either a direct quotation or simply a paraphrase. You may cite more if your argument requires it, but keep in mind that I’m looking to see that you’re **analyzing and engaging** with the source in your citation, not simply regurgitating the information.

Each prompt will have a slightly different citation format; see the specifics under each prompt.

## Prompts

### 1. Do you think Aeneas was justified in killing Turnus at the end of the *Aeneid*? Why or why not?

Cite by the *Aeneid*'s book and line number. An example:

> Turnus asks Aeneas for mercy: “For you have won, and the Ausonians have seen me, beaten, stretch my hands; Lavinia is yours; then do not press your hatred further” (book 12, lines 1249-1251).

OR

> At book 12, lines 1249-1251, Turnus asks Aeneas for mercy: “For you have won, and the Ausonians have seen me, beaten, stretch my hands; Lavinia is yours; then do not press your hatred further.”

### 2. Despite the name of Plautus’ *Casina*, Casina herself never appears in the play. Who is the main character of *Casina*, then? And why?

Cite only by line number of the *Casina*. An example:

> Myrrhina comments metatheatrically on their ruse: “No playwright has ever devised a better / Plot than this clever production of ours” (860-861).

### 3. Is Livy an “objective” historian? Cite and analyze specific examples to support your answer.

Cite BOTH by chapter number AND the page reference in Hackett. For example:

> Livy explains where the “she-wolf” of the story of Romulus and Remus may have originated: “There are some who think that this miraculous story originated because Larentia was called ‘she-wolf’ among the shepherd community, since she had been a prostitute” (4; Hackett, p. 147).

### 4. Anchises at *Aeneid* 6.1135-1137 tells Aeneas, “remember, Roman, these will be your arts: / to teach the ways of peace to those you conquer, / to spare defeated peoples, tame the proud.” Does Augustus follow these rules, according to his own account in *The Accomplishments of the Deified Augustus*?

Cite BOTH by chapter number AND the page reference in Hackett. For example:

> Augustus describes how he established colonies all around the Mediterranean, including twenty-eight colonies in Italy (28; Hackett, p. 21).

### 5. ‘Graffiti and grave inscriptions allow us to hear the voice of people who are typically silent in literary texts.’ Is this statement true or false? Use the inscriptions and graffiti in Hackett as evidence for your argument.

Cite by the inscription or graffito number in Hackett with subsection number, if applicable. For example,

> In the *Praise of Turia*, the husband praises Turia’s many good qualities with an instance of *praeteritio*: “Your domestic virtues — modesty, obedience, kindness, even temper, eagerness for working wool, religious reverence free from superstition, humbleness in your use of adornment, modesty in your style of dress — why should I mention them?” (1.1)

> Inscription 45 laments a young baby who died after only 9 months of life: “Here lies a pitiable infant stolen from her mother’s arms before she had lived nine full circuits of the moon. Her grieving mother and father weep for her as she lies, little body enclosed in a marble tomb.”

### 6. Katharina Volk suggests two possibilities for how we view Ovid and his poetry: “One possibility is to view Ovid as a proto-feminist. He’s trying to give women a voice. The other way to think about it is that he’s an extreme sexist.” Which of these options is closer to the truth?

Cite by work name, book number, and line number for Ovid’s works in Hackett; cite by work name and page number for citations from the *Metamorphoses*. Examples:

> Ovid advocates for adultery by means of a metaphor: “The crop is always richer in someone else’s field, his cow’s udder seem a bit more swollen with milk” (*The Art of Love* 1.349-350).

> Pygmalion sculpts a perfect woman, literally objectified as a statue: “But meanwhile / He made, with marvelous art, an ivory statue, / As white as snow, and gave it greater beauty / Than any girl could have, and fell in love / with his own workmanship" (*Metamorphoses*, p. 242).

### 7. Is Lucius’ conversion to the cult of Isis at the end of Apuleius’ *The Golden Ass* serious or satiric?

Cite by book number and chapter number. For example:

> Lucius begs Isis to restore his human form: “Let my sufferings, my dangers so far suffice. Drive off from me this hateful four-footed configuration, return me to the sight of my people, give me back myself, Lucius” (11.2).

### 8. Is Tacitus’ *Agricola* more a biography or a work of historiography, according to our modern definitions?

Cite by chapter number and sentence number. For example:

> Tacitus ends the *Agricola* with a promise of immortality for Agricola: “Agricola, whose story here is told, will outlive death, to be our children’s heritage” (46.4).
