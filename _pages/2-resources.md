5. Other readings in PDF form or available online -- links provided in detailed schedule.

Please note that three of the four texts are available to you for free as an e-book through Dinand Library, so if you do not wish to purchase your own copy, you do not have to! The only text that is not available as an e-book through Dinand is Humphries/Reed’s *Metamorphoses*. You can get a copy of that book (and any others you wish to purchase for yourself) at the Holy Cross Bookstore or online through such vendors as Amazon. If you choose a vendor other than the Holy Cross Bookstore or Amazon (through the links that I’ve provided), make sure to use the ISBN number to purchase the correct version of the text.

The cost of books should never be a deterrent to participation in a class that you want to take. If you have trouble affording our course books, please let me know, and I will work to get you affordable copies through the resources of the College.
