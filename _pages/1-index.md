This course is an introduction to the literature of ancient Rome, from roughly the 3rd century B.C.E. to the 2nd century C.E., a span of about 500 years. We will read works of various genres of Roman literature in translation, including comedy, tragedy, historical prose, epic, elegiac and nugatory poetry, epistles, and epigraphy. The goal is to gain a basic understanding of the progression of Roman literature and how each work or genre relates to social conditions in Rome at the time, especially with regard to gender and interpersonal relationships.
